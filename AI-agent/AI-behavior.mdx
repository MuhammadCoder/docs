### **Define how your AI should behave**

In the configuration section, you can:

- Set conversation goals (bookings, general info, sales).
- Choose the response tone (formal, friendly, direct, etc.).
- Set **automatic escalations** when certain topics are detected.

  _Example: “If a customer mentions a complaint, notify the team and send them to the support link.”_
