<Info>
  In the **AI \> Sources** section, you can upload and organize key information about your business across 4 areas.
</Info>

## **1. Website**

The AI automatically extracts content from your website.

Make sure it’s up to date.

---

## **2. Text**

Add any information not available on your website (policies, promotions, services, menus, etc.).

You can also paste links to Google Drive documents so the AI can share visual content (PDFs, images, or videos).

**Examples of useful content**:

- [General – for any type of business](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fsmt6ZZg1XIFjFv3brUXKf76w_I_480BaA-BfwPaM4o/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Hotels – specific example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UnSdkvzLJ6Q4NrD6ngc-t99uEMB6x_irvTND1DZVwWc/edit?usp=sharing)

---

## **3. Files**

Upload PDFs or images. The AI will read and use the content as reference.

_These files are not shared directly with the customer._

---

## **4. Providers** _(hotels only)_

If you have a PMS connected (like Cloudbeds), the AI will use that data to respond about bookings, rates, availability, etc.
