## 1. Set up your AI agent

[**AI Settings →**](https://app.visitoai.com/ai)

Make sure your AI is ready to help your customers by completing these steps:

### Add sources

Train your AI by providing relevant business information.

- **Website**

  Scan your business website to extract its content and help your AI answer accurately.
- **Text**

  Manually add useful information, such as policies, descriptions or FAQs to improve AI responses.
- **Files**

  Upload PDF, CSV, or image files with key data that your AI can reference when chatting with users.

### Customize behavior

Tailor how your AI communicates and when to escalate to a human.

- **AI behavior**

  Use instructions to define the agent’s personality, tone, and style. These do not add knowledge, but guide how it talks.

  Be clear and specific to align the agent with your business voice.
- **Escalation rules**

  Define situations that require human follow-up.

  For example: If a user asks for help or sends a payment receipt, the AI will inform them that someone from your team will follow up and notify your staff automatically.

### Test your AI

Try a sample conversation to see how your AI responds in real time, based on your added content and settings.
